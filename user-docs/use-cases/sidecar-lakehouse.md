# Lakehouse Projections with the Cassandra Sidecar

This page explains how CQLite fits into a **Parquet projection pipeline** that is
triggered by Cassandra SSTable flush events, co-located with the
[Apache Cassandra Sidecar](https://github.com/apache/cassandra-sidecar).

The internal position document (`docs/architecture/cassandra-sidecar-parquet-projections.md`)
is the authoritative source of truth for CQLite maintainers. This page is the
user-facing distillation.

:::tip[Querying live, not projecting]
If you want to run distributed SQL directly over a cluster's SSTables (rather than
materializing Parquet), see the
[Arrow Flight server & Trino connector](/cqlite/user-docs/flight-trino/) — it also
uses the Cassandra Sidecar, for ring/token-range discovery.
:::

## What is already built

The read-to-Parquet pipeline is largely in place:

1. **CQLite reads externally-discovered SSTables** via `open_with_discovered_sstables()` —
   the integration hook for "the Sidecar told me where a new SSTable is, read it."
2. **Memory-bounded streaming reads** via `execute_streaming()` keep peak memory
   predictable on large tables.
3. **Parquet output** is available via `--out parquet` in the CLI, via
   `db.export_parquet(...)` / `db.exportParquet(...)` in the Python and Node
   bindings, and as an embeddable writer in `cqlite-core` behind the `parquet`
   cargo feature.

A minimal per-SSTable projection is already expressible as a one-shot CLI call:

```bash
cqlite --schema users.cql \
       --data-dir /var/lib/cassandra/data/my_ks/users-<uuid>/ \
       --query "SELECT * FROM my_ks.users" \
       --out parquet -o /projections/users/nb-<gen>.parquet
```

### Trigger options

The Sidecar does not expose a push stream of "memtable flushed" events. Options:

| Trigger | Mechanism | Trade-off |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Filesystem watch | `inotify` on the table data dir; key on `TOC.txt` (written last ⇒ SSTable complete) | Simplest, reliable; per-host |
| Commitlog CDC | Cassandra CDC on the commitlog | Ordered + carries timestamps; closest to correct CDC; more setup |
| Sidecar API polling | Diff SSTable component listings per table | Easy; latency = poll interval |
| Diagnostic events / JMX | SSTable lifecycle notifications | JVM-side; reintroduces a cluster dependency |

For a simple bulk projection, **filesystem watch keyed on `TOC.txt`** is the pragmatic
default. For correctness-sensitive pipelines, commitlog CDC is the better source — see
the delta semantics section below for why.

:::note
A `*-Data.db` file appearing is not always a memtable flush — it can also be a
**compaction** output. For downstream lake purposes this is usually fine (and often
desirable), but if "flush only" semantics matter, the source must distinguish them.
:::

## ⚠ Delta semantics — this caveat is load-bearing

**A flushed SSTable is a *delta*, not a table snapshot.**

This is inherent to Cassandra's storage model — not a CQLite defect. Four properties
combine to make a naive Parquet-union of per-flush files silently wrong:

1. **Rows are partial / superseded.** The same primary key can appear across many
   SSTables; the live value is the per-cell last-write-wins (LWW) merge of all of them.
   One flush's Parquet reflects only that flush's writes.

2. **Tombstones carry deletes.** A flush can contain row, range, or cell tombstones and
   TTL expirations. The current projection has no representation of these, so a naive
   union of insert rows will **resurrect deleted data**.

3. **Reconciliation requires write-timestamps.** LWW merge is driven by each cell's
   `writetime`. A plain `SELECT *` drops it, so two flushes cannot be correctly merged
   downstream without it.

4. **Absent-vs-null is collapsed.** CQLite's `SELECT *` flattens Cassandra's sparse
   cell-sets into a rectangular result; a cell not written in a particular flush is
   indistinguishable from a null.

### Two coherent approaches — pick deliberately

**CDC / append-log projection (recommended).** Treat each flushed SSTable as an
immutable event batch → one Parquet file per generation. Embrace that it is a delta.
For correctness, **carry `writetime` and represent tombstones** (e.g. `__writetime` /
`__deleted` columns, Debezium-style). Downstream (Spark/Trino/Iceberg) performs the
merge. Idempotent; matches the immutable-SSTable grain.

**Current-snapshot projection.** To reflect current table state, point
`open_with_discovered_sstables()` at *all* live SSTables for the table so CQLite's read
path performs the LWW merge, then export. Correct, but re-reads everything on each flush.

## Type mapping fidelity

The type mapping is **analytics-grade for schema-aware queries**: query results carry
the authoritative schema `CqlType`, and the Parquet writer maps it recursively to a
faithful Arrow schema.

| CQL type | Arrow/Parquet | Fidelity |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| boolean, tinyint … bigint, float, double | Boolean, Int8/16/32/64, Float32/64 | Clean |
| text / varchar / ascii | Utf8 | Clean |
| blob | Binary | Clean |
| timestamp | Timestamp(ms, UTC) | Clean |
| uuid / timeuuid | FixedSizeBinary(16) + `arrow.uuid` extension | Clean (UUID logical annotation) |
| date | `Date32` | Clean |
| time | `Time64(Nanosecond)` | Clean |
| decimal | `Decimal128(38, 9)` | Fixed column scale 9; checked rescale, overflow errors deterministically |
| varint | `Decimal128(38, 0)` | Values > 38 digits error deterministically |
| list&lt;T&gt; / set&lt;T&gt; | `List<T>` | Typed elements, recursive (sets export as List — Arrow has no set type) |
| map&lt;K,V&gt; | `Map<K, V>` | Typed keys (non-null) and values, recursive |
| tuple / UDT | `Struct` | Positional `field_N` / schema field names |
| frozen&lt;T&gt; | Same as T | Transparent at every nesting level |
| inet | Utf8 (canonical text) | Deliberate: no standard Arrow inet type |
| duration | Utf8 (CQL text form) | `parquet` crate v53 cannot write `Interval(MonthDayNano)` |

Collections, UDTs, and high-precision scalars all support columnar predicate pushdown
in downstream consumers (Trino, Spark, DuckDB). The batch and streaming writers produce
identical schemas and values. See
[Output Formats](/cqlite/user-docs/output-formats/) for the full table and notes.

## Embedding the Parquet writer

The Parquet writer lives in `cqlite-core/src/export/parquet.rs` behind an
off-by-default `parquet` feature flag. A projection service can call the writer
directly as a library without a subprocess, and the Python
(`db.export_parquet(...)`) and Node (`db.exportParquet(...)`) bindings export
Parquet natively. CQLite produces Parquet files only; committing them to
Iceberg/Delta remains the external committer's job.

## Roadmap: delta-aware projections

Fully reconcilable CDC-mode projections need a delta-scan API that streams per-cell
`writetime`, TTL/expiry, and an operation discriminator covering all five Cassandra
delete shapes (upsert, static upsert, row delete, range delete, partition delete),
paired with a delta-aware Parquet writer and an export subcommand. **This is not yet
available.** Until it lands, preserve `writetime` and represent tombstones yourself
(see [Recommendations](#recommendations)) so a union of per-flush Parquet is
reconcilable rather than silently wrong.

## Schema sourcing

CQLite requires the CQL schema to decode an SSTable — it does not guess types.
The projection service must source and cache the schema — flush events do not carry it.
The practical approach is to pull it from `DESCRIBE TABLE` output and keep it in sync
with schema changes.

## Comparison with TiDB's approach

TiDB's TiFlash is instructive: it is a Raft learner that receives every committed write
in real-time, providing a strongly consistent, transactionally-consistent columnar
replica. TiCDC (the structural analog to this pipeline) tails the ordered row-change
log and emits Kafka or cloud-storage changefeeds with explicit insert/update/delete
events and commit timestamps.

Our approach's distinct value is **open, lake-native columnar output from Cassandra with
no cluster dependency in the read path**. The trade-off is that Cassandra has no ordered
committed log — its source of truth is independently-flushed, LWW-merged SSTables — so
any columnar projection is inherently a delta-reconciliation problem. CQLite already
provides the type fidelity and the embeddable writer that projection needs; full
delta-aware scanning (above) is the remaining piece.

## Recommendations

1. **Model it as CDC/append-log, not snapshot.** It matches the immutable-SSTable grain
   and is idempotent per generation.
2. **Land in a table format (Iceberg or Delta), not bare Parquet files.** Those provide
   snapshot isolation, compaction, and merge-on-read that otherwise you must build by hand.
3. **Preserve `writetime` and represent tombstones** (`__writetime` / `__deleted`
   columns) so projections are reconcilable. Without this, a union of per-flush Parquet
   is silently wrong.
4. **Prefer commitlog CDC over raw flush events** when correctness matters.
5. **Embed the writer rather than shelling out** — the Parquet writer lives in
   `cqlite-core` behind the `parquet` feature, and the
   Python/Node bindings expose it directly.
